## 🚀 Course Overview  
The **Mobile Programming** course provided a comprehensive introduction to mobile application development using Flutter. Key learning objectives included:  
- Understanding mobile app history and operating systems.  
- Setting up the development environment for Flutter.  
- Creating interactive user interfaces with **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**.  
- Implementing state management using **setState** and **Provider**.  
- Using layout widgets: **Row**, **Column**, **Container**, **Expanded**, **ListView**, **GridView**, **Drawer**.  
- Handling user input through **TextField** and **FormField**, including validation.  
- Navigating between screens and passing data efficiently.  
- Consuming APIs with **HTTP GET/POST requests**.  
- Persisting data locally using **SQLite (sqflite)**.  
- Prototyping app designs using **Figma**.  
- Version control and project management with **GitHub**.

## 🗓️ Topics and Activities Covered  

1. **Course introduction and environment setup** — Flutter configuration, first project creation.  
2. **Widgets and UI basics** — Buttons, text, colors, `child` and `children`.  
3. **App structure** — AppBar, titles, interactive buttons triggering console messages.  
4. **Layouts** — Row, Column, Container, Expanded, Image, Icon.  
5. **StatelessWidget applications** — Apps without dynamic state and simple UI updates.  
6. **Lists and grids** — ListView, GridView, creating interactive menus.  
7. **Navigation and detailed screens** — Multi-page apps with intuitive back navigation.  
8. **StatefulWidget and setState** — Dynamic state changes, cascading data updates.  
9. **FormField and validation** — Login forms and input validation.  
10. **Provider implementation** — State management across multiple widgets.  
11. **HTTP requests** — GET and POST requests for API consumption.  
12. **Prototyping and final project** — Designing 12 screens in Figma, implementing login system, data persistence, navigation, and reusable components.  
13. **Project presentation and evaluation** — Finalization, testing, and deployment of the project.
